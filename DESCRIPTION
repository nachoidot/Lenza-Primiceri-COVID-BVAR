Description: A faithful line-by-line port of the MATLAB code accompanying
    Lenza & Primiceri (2022) "How to Estimate a VAR after March 2020"
    (Journal of Applied Econometrics). This package implements Bayesian Vector
    Autoregressions with time-varying volatility for the COVID-19 era, following
    the Giannone-Lenza-Primiceri (2015) methodology with extensions for structural
    breaks in volatility. All algorithms, priors, and estimation procedures are
    numerically identical to the original MATLAB implementation.
